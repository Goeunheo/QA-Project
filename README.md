# Manual & API Testing – ReserveCalifornia.gov / Recreation.gov

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on testing two real-world web applications:
- **ReserveCalifornia.gov:** Manual testing on user reservation workflows.
- **Recreation.gov:** API testing on public camping reservation APIs.

## 🧠 Objective
Designed and executed comprehensive manual and API tests to identify usability and data integrity issues in real reservation systems.

## 🧩 My Role
- Defined testing scope and priorities (functional, usability, API).
- Authored 24 detailed test cases and reported 4 key bugs.
- Designed API test suites for recreation.gov using Postman and Python (Requests).

## 🧾 Deliverables
| Type | Description | Tool |
|------|--------------|------|
| Test Cases | 24 structured cases (login, reservation, payment, calendar) | Excel |
| Bug Reports | 4 validated defects | Excel |
| API Testing | 10 endpoints (GET/POST for availability & booking) | Postman |

## 📊 Key Insights
- Found inconsistencies between UI and API availability data.
- Improved test coverage by aligning UI & API test flows.

## 🚀 Next Step
Building automation scripts for Recreation.gov to auto-check available reservation dates using Python + Selenium.
